# PwMan
PwMan is a gpg Password Storing Program. It uses your gpg ID to encrypt and store files. This is a prototype as a later version will be released. I want to implement tkinter into my program and make it a little more failsafe. to use on linux, python pwman.py ...I also included a logging function to make sure your files remain untouched. With later plans to encrypt the log every so often, for verification. Please Look at Documentation on python and gpgme, GPGME is a gnupg program tied to Python as a module. It is very specific to install, and secure.
